[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/amanelis/baboon.png)](https://gemnasium.com/amanelis/baboon)

A simple and light weight deployment library for a ruby on rails application 3.0+.

---
# Install
This must be installed under a current rails application. We recommend vendoring or installing through bundler.

	gem install baboon
	

---
# Configure

In your Gemfile, then `bundle install`.

	group :development do
		gem 'baboon'
	end
	
Now that the gem is installed, run the config generator

	rails g baboon:install

This will build a file into your application under `config/initializers/baboon.rb`. Open this file and start editing. Here is an example of the 8 configuration options:

	Baboon.configure do |config|
  	config.application  = 'Vacuum HQ'
	  config.repository   = 'git@github.com:amanelis/vacuum.git'
	  config.releases     = 5
	  config.deploy_path  = '/home/rails/vacuum'
	  config.deploy_user  = :rails
	  config.branch       = :master
	  config.rails_env    = :production
	  config.servers      = ['server_1', 'server_2']
	end
