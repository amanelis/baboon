A simple and light weight deployment library for a ruby on rails application 3.0+. No symlinks, no releases, just git and your application. 


# How it works
Baboon is simple. You provide your server addresses, environments, path, repository, username and Baboon does the rest. By running a simple `baboon deploy {env}` it will do all neccessary operations you intend for it to do on a full deploy to a production staging or development server. All you need is a working rails application on a server with a git repository.

---
# Install
This must be installed under a current rails application. We recommend vendoring or installing through bundler.

	gem install baboon

---
# Configure

In your Gemfile, then `bundle install`.

	group :development do
	  gem 'baboon'
	end
	
Now that the gem is installed, run the config generator

	rails g baboon:install

This will build a file into your application under `config/initializers/baboon.rb`. Open this file and start editing. Here is an example of the main configuration options:

	Baboon.configure do |config|
  	  config.application  = 'Vacuum HQ'
	  config.repository   = 'git@github.com:amanelis/vacuum.git'
	  config.deploy_path  = '/home/rails/vacuum'
	  config.deploy_user  = 'rails
	  config.branch       = 'master'
	  config.rails_env    = 'production'
	  config.servers      = ['192.168.1.1', '192.168.1.2']
	end
	
These must be properly filled out so baboon can properly make deploys.

---
# Commands
Once everything is setup you can run `baboon` to see availabe tasks. Start by seeing if your configuration was properlly generated.

	baboon configuration
	
Once you see and verify your Baboon.configuration you can now go ahead and test a deploy. For now, lets assume you have everything in your config correct and you are deploying to production:

	baboon deploy
	
Thats it? Yeah, thats it! You should see your bundle installing and Baboon running all tasks. Custom tasks coming soon.

The next commands that will be realeased with future versions of baboon are:

  baboon setup    # no manually editing of configuration file
	baboon check 		# checks the server and config file for proper configuration
	baboon migrate 		# runs pending migrations
	baboon restart 		# restarts your server
	baboon rollback 	# rolls back your to your previous commit, info in ./log/baboon.log
	baboon rake 		# run custom rake tasks on server
	baboon execute 		# run a single command on the server
	baboon shell	 	# open a remote shell with the config user

---
# CLI

This is coming very soonâ€¦
